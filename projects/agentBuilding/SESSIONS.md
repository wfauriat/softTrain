### 2026-05-26 — Project setup + first Ollama call

- Created `projects/agentBuilding/` with `CLAUDE.md` (intent + tutor work mode + session-log convention).
- Branched off `main` into `project/agent-building` to keep this work separable in the larger training repo.
- First commit landed. Practiced commit hygiene: subject ≤50 chars, imperative mood, blank line before body — amended once to fix structure.
- **First brick (in progress)**: single HTTP POST to Ollama's `/api/chat` endpoint, no abstractions, hardcoded values.
  - Chose `httpx` over `requests` (matches a future deployment target that uses httpx + OpenAI API + Kerberos).
  - Chose Ollama's *native* API over its OpenAI-compatible endpoint, deliberately — to feel provider variance before designing any wrapper.
- **Bugs hit along the way**:
  - 405 on `/api/chat` in browser → method confusion (GET vs POST). Status-code mental model installed.
  - 400 from server → double JSON encoding: passed `json=json.dumps(dict)` instead of `json=dict`. Learned `httpx`'s `json=` serializes for you.
  - Timeout → httpx default is 5s; bumped to 120 to survive CPU inference.
  - Underlying cause of the slow CPU run: NVIDIA driver broken (kernel `6.17.0-29` missing matching `linux-modules-nvidia-595-open` package). Diagnosed and noted a fix to apply via sudo user.
- **First successful response**: 200 OK, qwen3:8b answered, ~5 tok/s on CPU. Goal now: parse with `response.json()` and extract just `message.content`.
- **Next**: clean response parsing, then handle qwen3's `<think>...</think>` blocks (or switch to `qwen3-nothink`).

---

### 2026-05-26 — Response parsing + first `chat()` wrapper

- GPU driver fix confirmed working (RTX 4060 visible, driver 595.71.05, CUDA 13.2). Ollama back on GPU.
- **Response parsing**: switched from `response.text` (raw JSON string) to `response.json()["message"]["content"]`. Detour through Python inspection tools (`type`, `dir`, `vars`, `pprint.pp`) to map the response shape interactively.
- **Tooling refresher**: covered `python -i`, `python -c`, `python -m pdb`, and `breakpoint()`. Notes added to `notes.md` as a cheatsheet — three sections: object inspection, REPL entry points, pdb commands.
- **First abstraction — `chat(messages: list[dict]) -> str`**:
  - Lifted `MODEL` and `OLLAMA_URL` to module-level constants.
  - Function builds payload, POSTs, returns just the assistant content.
  - Side effect: `import agent` no longer hits the network — sanity check via `python -c "import agent"` works.
- **First error-handling attempt (parked)**:
  - Wrapped in `try/except BaseException`, returned status code or exception text as a string on failure.
  - **Critique surfaced (not yet applied)**: function lies about return type — error strings and success strings are indistinguishable, will poison conversation history downstream. `BaseException` swallows `KeyboardInterrupt`.
  - **Recommended direction for next time**: drop the try/except, use `response.raise_for_status()`, let exceptions propagate. Design a real error model only when a caller actually needs one.
- **Next**: revisit error handling (Option A: let it raise), then move to multi-turn conversation (append assistant reply to `messages` and loop).

---

### 2026-05-27 — VSCode environment setup (deliberate detour from code)

- Step back from agent code to set up a proper dev environment. Three pieces tackled in order: Claude Code IDE extension → autocomplete posture → debugging config.
- **Claude Code extension** installed via `code --install-extension anthropic.claude-code`. Inline diff UI, auto-context from selection/open tabs, `Ctrl+Esc` to invoke on selection.
- **Autocomplete philosophy**: distinguished three independent layers — AI ghost-text (off, never installed), IntelliSense popups (off by default), parameter hints (kept on). Reason: in acquisition mode, auto-popups become ratification, not learning. Manual `Ctrl+Space` summons IntelliSense when genuinely needed.
- **`.vscode/settings.json`** written with 6 keys: `editor.quickSuggestions` all off, `suggestOnTriggerCharacters: false`, `parameterHints.enabled: true`, `wordBasedSuggestions: off`, `python.analysis.autoImportCompletions: false`, `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode: basic`.
- **Scope decision**: settings placed at `agentBuilding/.vscode/`, not at the training repo root. Narrower than originally suggested — keeps the discipline local to this project; revisit later if it should be ambient across `tutorials/`/`kata/`.
- **Linux gotcha**: `Ctrl+Space` often captured by IBus/fcitx at the OS level. Verified the suggestion engine works via command palette → "Trigger Suggest" before debugging keybinding.
- **`.vscode/launch.json`** written with a single generic "Python: Current File" config: `type: debugpy`, `request: launch`, `program: "${file}"`, `console: integratedTerminal`. Skipped the agent.py-specific config — premature for now. Verified F5 hits a gutter breakpoint and pauses in `agent.py`.
- **IntelliSense cheatsheet** appended to `notes.md` (keybindings table + icon legend + Linux-capture warning).
- **Next**: back to agent code. Pending from previous session: revisit `chat()` error handling (let it raise via `response.raise_for_status()`), then multi-turn loop.

---

### 2026-05-27 — `chat()` error model: transport + protocol layers

- **Working mode**: deliberated up-front on whether to do "Claude writes broken code, user PR-reviews it" vs tutor-first. Settled on tutor-first now, PR-review exercise reserved for a later function (conversation history or tool dispatcher) so design-and-write reps come first.
- **Three-layer failure taxonomy** adopted as the mental model for the HTTP call: **transport** (couldn't reach server — `httpx.RequestError` family), **protocol** (non-2xx status code — `httpx.HTTPStatusError`), **contract** (response received but JSON shape wrong — `KeyError` / `JSONDecodeError`). Each layer has its own moment in the call sequence and its own remediation.
- **Design call**: transport = *runtime* concern, surface as catchable exception so caller can retry/alert. Protocol + contract = usually *programmer errors*, fail loud with good context. Don't catch what you can't sensibly handle.
- **Return-type honesty**: identified the old pattern (`except BaseException: return str(e)`) as a lying return type — caller can't distinguish a real reply from an error string. Replaced with raise-based error model. `-> str` now actually means "the assistant's reply, or this function raises."
- **Custom exceptions, not pass-through**: introduced `BackendConnectionError` and `BackendResponseError` as module-level classes. Chosen over (a) bare `raise` of httpx exceptions and (b) builtin `ConnectionError` — reason: project explicitly plans a second backend (Anthropic), and both adapters should raise the same application-level types so caller code stays backend-agnostic from day one. Common `BackendError` base class noted but deferred.
- **Concrete idioms picked up**: `response.raise_for_status()` to convert non-2xx to exception; `raise X(...) from e` to wrap while preserving the original via `__cause__`; implicit string concatenation inside parens for multi-line f-string messages (no `+`, no `\`).
- **httpx hierarchy insight**: `RequestError` and `HTTPStatusError` are *siblings* under `HTTPError`, not parent/child — so a single try block with two except clauses suffices, no nested try needed. Current code still has the nested form; flatten on next pass.
- **Empirical confirmations**: happy path returns model reply; bogus-port test produces `BackendConnectionError` with chained `httpx.ConnectError` underneath. Protocol path not yet exercised against a live Ollama (needs real port + nonexistent model name).
- **Side**: added `editor.rulers: [80]` to `.vscode/settings.json` for a soft 80-col guide. Brief detour on Python multi-line string idioms.
- **Next**: (1) flatten the nested try block; (2) fix the misleading `BackendResponseError` message to include `e.response.status_code` and `e.response.text`; (3) provoke and confirm the protocol path empirically; (4) decide whether to add a `BackendError` common base; (5) then move on to multi-turn conversation history.

---

### 2026-05-27 — Flattened try, refactor pass, contract layer explored & deferred

- **Flattened the nested try in `chat()`.** Two `except` clauses (HTTPStatusError, RequestError) now sit as peers on a single try — matches the transport/protocol mental model and matches httpx's sibling exception hierarchy. Indentation gotcha fixed on the way.
- **Small refactor pass (5 changes, all accepted):**
  - Dropped `from typing import List` → `list[dict]` (Python 3.9+ builtin generic).
  - Docstring grew a `Raises:` section so the return-type honesty extends to the doc.
  - `payload` dict reformatted with newline + trailing comma (key-stable diffs).
  - `REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 60` lifted to module-level constant alongside `MODEL` / `OLLAMA_URL`.
  - Indentation tidied.
- **Provoked the protocol path empirically.** Pointed `MODEL` at a nonexistent name; Ollama returned 404, `raise_for_status()` fired, `BackendResponseError` surfaced with status + body. Chained traceback via `from e` visible — confirms the design from previous session.
- **Explored a contract layer.** Added `BackendError` base + `BackendContractError` subclass + `except (KeyError, TypeError, json.JSONDecodeError)` tuple-catch, motivated by anticipated multi-backend symmetry. Provoked it with `{"foo": "bar"}["message"]`. First version had two bugs the test surfaced: `e.response` doesn't exist on these exception types (would itself raise `AttributeError` and mask the wrap), and missing `from e`. Both fixed; the chained traceback then read cleanly.
- **Decided to remove the contract layer for now.** Today it adds no information over the bare `KeyError` traceback (the wrapper just re-raises `str(e)`). When the Anthropic backend lands and contract shapes actually diverge, bring it back with a real message (e.g. include the actual keys received). `BackendError` base + the two real subclasses (connection/response) stayed — they have meaningfully different retry semantics.
- **End-state `agent.py`:** 37 lines. Three exception classes (base + two), two except clauses, two `from e` chains, happy path is a 4-line straight read. Verified working against live Ollama (qwen3:8b on GPU).
- **Idioms picked up along the way:** Python 3.11+ traceback underline (`~~~^^^` pointing at the failing subexpression), the distinction between *"direct cause of"* (from `raise X from Y`) vs *"during handling of"* (implicit, often a bug in the except block).
- **Next:** multi-turn conversation history — append assistant reply to `messages`, loop.

---

### 2026-05-27 — `chat()` design audit, parameterization pass, rename to `ollama_backend.py`

- **Design audit of `chat()` as a module-level API** (vs script-level function). Identified five things that would matter once the function gets a second caller or a second backend: (1) module-level constants read implicitly, (2) `httpx.post` creates+discards a client per call (no DI seam, no connection reuse), (3) `"think": False` hardcoded in the payload (Ollama- and qwen3-specific), (4) return type is bare `str` — soon insufficient for token counts / stop reasons / tool calls, (5) no abstraction over backend choice.
- **Applied (1)–(3) one step at a time** so each change was reviewable in isolation:
  - **Parameterize config** as keyword-only args with module-constant defaults: `model`, `url`, `timeout`. Use of the `*,` separator forces keyword calls at the override site — readable when there are 3+ optional args.
  - **Inject `httpx.Client`** via `client: httpx.Client | None = None`. Default `None` falls back to `httpx.post()` (today's behavior); passing a client enables connection reuse, shared headers (auth), and test-time injection of fakes. Avoided `client = httpx.Client()` as default — that's the mutable-default-at-import footgun.
  - **Expose `think`** as a keyword arg. Was hardcoded; now per-call.
  - Default-only call site (`chat(messages)`) is unchanged — `__main__` block needed no edits. Good shape for API evolution.
- **Parked (4) — structured return type.** Promoting to `@dataclass ChatResult { content, tokens_in, tokens_out, stop_reason, ... }` is the right move *when* a caller actually needs more than the assistant string. Doing it now is speculative. Note: widening this return type later is a breaking change for any caller using `chat(...)` directly — accept that future churn, or front-load when the first real need lands.
- **Parked (5) — backend abstraction (ABC / Protocol / class refactor).** Sibling per-backend files (`ollama_backend.py`, future `anthropic_backend.py`) sharing the `BackendError` hierarchy is the working pattern for now. An abstract `Backend` ABC or `Protocol` becomes worthwhile the moment there are two adapters *and* a caller that wants to swap between them generically. Until then, "caller picks the import" is cleaner than an inheritance tree built for one occupant.
- **Renamed `agent.py` → `ollama_backend.py`** via `git mv` (history preserved). Triggered by realizing the error messages legitimately say "Ollama" — the issue wasn't the messages, it was the file name pretending to be generic. Now message specificity is honest: it *is* the Ollama backend reporting that Ollama is unreachable.
- **Error-message-specificity principle (worth keeping):** exception *types* are the backend-agnostic abstraction; exception *messages* should be backend-specific diagnostics. Removing the backend name from messages would erase useful information from tracebacks once multiple backends coexist.
- **Doc trail:** `notes.md` still contains three `import agent` cheatsheet examples — idiom-level, not strictly wrong, but candidates for refresh to `import ollama_backend` next time they're touched.
- **Next:** multi-turn conversation history (new session). Caller-side: append assistant reply to `messages`, loop. Likely the first place a long-lived `httpx.Client` gets passed in for real.

---

### 2026-05-27 — Multi-turn loop in `main()`, system prompt

- **First REPL loop**: `main()` with local `messages: list[dict]`, `with httpx.Client() as client:` around a `while True`, `input("> ")` per turn. EOF (`Ctrl+D`) and `KeyboardInterrupt` (`Ctrl+C`) caught as a tuple and treated as clean exits; `/quit` and case-insensitive `quit` also break. Client now persists across turns — first real use of the injection seam added last session.
- **State-management design**: build `user_msg` first, call `chat(messages=[*messages, user_msg], client=client)`, *then* append both `user_msg` and assistant reply to `messages`. If `chat()` raises, `messages` is unchanged — no orphaned user turn in history. The `[*messages, user_msg]` idiom is shallow-copy-plus-append in one expression.
- **System prompt**: added `PROMPT_SYSTEM` as a module-level constant alongside `MODEL` / `OLLAMA_URL`; prepended as `{"role": "system", ...}` before the loop starts. Empirically confirmed qwen3:8b honours it (pirate-persona test).
- **Idioms picked up**: implicit string concatenation inside parens (`( "...a" " ...b" )`) replacing backslash line continuation — same trick already used in the `BackendResponseError` f-string.
- **Parked**: promoting the system prompt to a `chat(..., system: str | None = None)` keyword arg. Today `main()` is the only caller; lift it into `chat()` when a second caller wants one without managing the messages list itself.
- **Next**: pick one of — structured return type (`@dataclass ChatResult`), second backend (Anthropic SDK), or first tool-calling scaffolding.

---

### 2026-05-27 — `ChatResult` dataclass, notes.md cheatsheets

- **Picked the dataclass thread** for learning, even though no caller pulled hard on widening the return type yet. Acknowledged the tradeoff: today `main()` only uses `.content`, so this is a learning-first widening — accept the future churn if more callers land.
- **Introduced `@dataclass(frozen=True) ChatResult`** with three fields: `content: str`, `tokens_in: int`, `tokens_out: int`. Frozen because a result is a value (a past outcome), not a state. Lives in `ollama_backend.py` for now; deferred extracting to a shared `types.py` until the second backend actually shows divergent shapes.
- **`chat()` now returns `ChatResult`.** JSON pulled into a local `data` so the construction reads cleanly: `ChatResult(content=data["message"]["content"], tokens_in=data["prompt_eval_count"], tokens_out=data["eval_count"])`. `main()` migrated to `.content` at two sites (history append, print) and gained a per-turn `tokens_in / tokens_out` debug line.
- **Empirical confirmation against live Ollama** (two-turn smoke test via `python -c`): turn 1 `tokens_in=45 / tokens_out=17`, turn 2 `tokens_in=78 / tokens_out=4`. Input grew with accumulated history; output tracked reply length ("Arrr!" → 4 tokens). Numbers are real, not zeros.
- **Contract assumption widened.** The construction assumes `prompt_eval_count` and `eval_count` are always present in Ollama's response — same contract-layer concern explored and parked previously. Left as a loud-on-failure `KeyError` for now (better than silent zeros in development).
- **`notes.md` got two cheatsheets** at "more than notes, less than full docs" depth (deliberate choice — coverage over exhaustivity):
  - **Dataclasses + typing primer**: minimal form, the four decorator knobs (`frozen` / `slots` / `kw_only` / `order`) with when-to-use, the `field(default_factory=...)` mutable-default rule, helpers (`asdict` / `astuple` / `replace` / `fields`), an annotation primer (`int | None`, `list[int]`, forward refs), and an anti-section (NamedTuple, pydantic/attrs).
  - **JSON stdlib**: the four entry points with the `s = string` mnemonic, type-mapping table (incl. dict-keys-become-strings round-trip pitfall), `dumps` formatting kwargs (`indent` / `sort_keys` / `separators` / `ensure_ascii` / `default` / `cls`), common patterns (pretty-print, JSON Lines), shell pipelines (`python -c`, `python -m json.tool`), gotchas, and when to reach for `orjson` / `ijson` / `pydantic`.
- **Idioms picked up**: `dataclasses.asdict()` as the standard bridge from frozen dataclass → JSON-serialisable dict (worth knowing for future logging); `python -m json.tool` as the no-`jq` stdlib JSON prettifier.
- **Next**: second backend (Anthropic SDK) — this is the call site that will actually pull on the parameterised `chat()` and on a shared `ChatResult` shape. Likely surfaces (a) the backend-abstraction decision (ABC vs Protocol vs sibling files) and (b) the `BackendContractError` reintroduction with a real message once shapes diverge.

---

### 2026-05-27 — `src/` layout, Anthropic backend happy path

- **Restructured into `src/`**: `ollama_backend.py` moved under `src/`, joined by new `src/backend.py` (shared `ChatResult` + `BackendError` hierarchy extracted) and `src/anthropic_backend.py`. Both backends now import the shared types from `src.backend`. `__init__.py` added. `.gitignore` extended for `.env`.
- **Anthropic `chat()` happy path landed.** Signature mirrors Ollama's where it can: `chat(messages, *, model, system, max_tokens, client) -> ChatResult`. Differences from Ollama parked in the signature itself: `system` (top-level Anthropic field, not a message-list entry) and `max_tokens` (required by the API, no default on the SDK side).
- **Bug squashed: `system=None` rejected by API.** Passing `system=None` through to `client.messages.create(...)` produced `400 invalid_request_error: 'system: Input should be a valid array'`. Distinction surfaced: "argument omitted" vs "argument explicitly null" are different things to an API that distinguishes optional from nullable. Fix is the conditional-kwargs idiom — build a dict, only add `"system"` when non-None, splat with `**kwargs` at the call site.
- **Lazy client instantiation.** `client: anthropic.Anthropic | None = None` with `if client is None: client = anthropic.Anthropic()` inside the function — mirrors the Ollama backend's transient-client pattern, also satisfies the type narrowing for `client.messages.create(...)`. SDK reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from env automatically, so the explicit `api_key=` parameter at the call site got dropped.
- **`load_dotenv()` placement deliberated.** Currently lives inside the `__main__` block of `anthropic_backend.py` — works for the script, but library imports of `chat()` won't auto-load `.env`. Three positions considered: module top-level (import side effect — surprising), inside `main()` (library users get the gotcha), or zero `load_dotenv()` in the library at all (push env management to the application edge). Left at current position; revisit when a unified REPL entry point lands.
- **Response shape mismatch noted.** Anthropic's `response.content` is a list of content blocks (`response.content[0].text` for plain text), `response.usage.input_tokens` / `.output_tokens` for token counts. Indexing `[0]` and assuming text is the happy-path read; the failure modes here are exactly where `BackendContractError` would come back with a real message.
- **Control-flow tangle caught and unwound.** Intermediate version had `client.messages.create(**kwargs)` accidentally nested inside the `if client is None:` branch, and the `if system is not None:` block placed *after* the call. Reshuffled to: build kwargs → conditionally add `system` → conditionally instantiate `client` → call → wrap in `ChatResult`. Top-to-bottom read, each step independent.
- **Parked: backend abstraction.** Two `chat()` functions now exist with overlapping-but-not-identical kwargs (Ollama: `url`/`timeout`/`think`; Anthropic: `system`/`max_tokens`). Two axes flagged for next session: (1) function vs object (constructor for per-backend config, method for per-call inputs) and (2) once classes exist, ABC vs `typing.Protocol` vs nothing. Read on the table: class-per-backend probably the bigger win; whether to formalise the static type comes after.
- **Next**: pick up the abstraction discussion. Sketch `OllamaBackend` / `AnthropicBackend` classes and let the call site reveal whether a `Protocol` is needed.

---

### 2026-05-29 — Import convention settled, root Makefile

- **Import convention decided: package + relative imports + `-m`.** Both backends now use `from .backend import ...`; `src/` is a real package (`__init__.py` earns its place); run via `python -m src.<module>` from the project root. Key framing: import form, run command, and pytest discovery are one coupled decision, not three. Rejected `from src.backend import` (hardcodes the layout name "src" into the namespace) and the flat-scripts option (relies on `sys.path[0]` magic, would need a `conftest`/path hack once tests arrive). Cost accepted consciously: lose `python src/x.py`, must use `-m`.
- **Root `Makefile` landed.** Targets `ollama_backend` / `anthropic_backend` → `$(PYTHON) -m src.<module>`, plus a `help` target placed first so bare `make` prints the menu instead of launching a REPL. `PYTHON` pinned to the venv absolute path (`/opt/venvs/pyDS/bin/python`) so it works from any shell, not just an activated one. `.PHONY` declared; tabs (not spaces) in recipes; `@echo` to suppress make's per-line command echo (the "doubled output" symptom). Bugs caught along the way: comma in `.PHONY` list (must be space-separated) and a `src.ollama_anthropic` module-name typo.
- **`test` target deferred.** pytest isn't set up (thread 2); holding the target until there's something to run rather than shipping a no-op.
- **`notes.md`: Makefile cheatsheet added.** Rule anatomy, the tab/echo/subshell gotchas, `=` vs `:=`, automatic + special variables, invocation flags, the self-documenting `help` idiom, and a when-not-to-use-make note (all-phony = task runner, where `just`/`tox` may fit better).
- **`notes.md`: packaging & imports cheatsheet added.** Captures the reasoning behind this session's import decision: the launch-mode → `sys.path`/`__package__` table (why `-m` makes `__main__` + relative imports coexist), absolute vs relative, and the API-design lever — re-exporting public names through `__init__.py` (+ `__all__`) so the public surface is decoupled from file layout. Plus the installable-package graduation step and circular-import/stdlib-shadowing gotchas.
- **Next**: thread 1 abstraction (`OllamaBackend` / `AnthropicBackend` classes), or thread 2 (first pytest pass). The Anthropic error-handling gap (`BackendContractError`, raw `response.content[0].text`) is still parked.

---

### 2026-05-29 — Package rename to `agentAPI`, pytest harness + first test

- **Renamed `src/` → `agentAPI/`** via `git mv` (history preserved). Relative imports (`from .backend import`) needed **zero** edits — the rename-safety payoff. Run command changed to `-m agentAPI.<module>`; `__init__.py` re-exports the public surface (`ChatResult`, `BackendError`, `__all__`).
- **pytest stood up.** `pyproject.toml` → `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` with `pythonpath = ["."]` (so `import agentAPI.*` resolves) + `testpaths = ["agentAPI/tests"]`. Lesson banked: a misspelled table (`[tool.pytest.ini.option]`) is silently ignored with only a warning — read the warnings. Tests live in `agentAPI/tests/`.
- **First test — ollama `chat()` happy path**, hand-rolled stubs. Two-layer fake (`FakeClient.post(...)` → `FakeResponse` with `raise_for_status`/`json`) injected through the existing `client=` DI seam. Asserts all three derived `ChatResult` fields with `!r` failure messages.
- **Concepts covered:** discovery rules, Arrange/Act/Assert, plain-`assert` + pytest rewriting, duck-typed stubs (don't subclass the real `httpx` types — that builds a real pool), the type-based-`except` vs duck-typed-call distinction, exit-code-5-on-empty.
- **Caught at review:** the test was red — canned `prompt_eval_count` (3) disagreed with the assert (12); the `!r` message + pytest introspection pinpointed it instantly. Reconciled to 12; renamed the test for behaviour; fixed the message key to `content`.
- **Concrete pull toward `Protocol` (the parked abstraction decision).** Pylance flags the duck-typed `FakeClient` against `chat`'s `client: httpx.Client | None` — nominal typing rejects a structural match. The proper fix is to type the seam as a `typing.Protocol` (structural), not the concrete class. First real evidence the parked ABC-vs-Protocol-vs-nothing call wants Protocol. Warning left visible as a marker (editor-only; runtime + pytest unaffected).
- **`notes.md`: pytest basics cheatsheet added** — to be amended with `pytest.raises` / mocking / fixtures.
- **Next**: two error-path tests — `post` raising `httpx.RequestError` → `BackendConnectionError` (easy), and `raise_for_status` raising `httpx.HTTPStatusError` → `BackendResponseError` (needs a response attached for `chat` to read `.status_code`/`.text`). Introduces `pytest.raises` and "raise the *real* exception type."

---

### 2026-05-29 — Ollama error-path tests, `pytest.raises`

- **Two error-translation tests added** for `chat`: `post` raising `httpx.RequestError` → `BackendConnectionError`, and `raise_for_status` raising `httpx.HTTPStatusError` (real `Request`/`Response` attached) → `BackendResponseError`. The full `chat` surface is now covered — happy path + both error paths.
- **`pytest.raises` introduced** — context manager asserting the block raises; `as excinfo` to assert on `excinfo.value` (message, and `.__cause__` from `raise … from e`).
- **Error-translation testing pattern banked:** the *fake* raises the real low-level library error; the *unit under test* catches and re-raises its own; the *test* asserts the unit's error — and asserting the message proves the unit extracted fields (status code/text) off the original, not just that *something* raised.
- **Subclass-matching insight:** `pytest.raises` / `except` / `isinstance` all match by inheritance, not exact type. `httpx.ConnectError` IS-A `httpx.RequestError`, so testing with the concrete `ConnectError` and asserting the base is both valid and more realistic. Nominal-typing counterpart to the duck-typed method-call lesson.
- **Fakes parameterized** — one `FakeClient(post_error=…, response=…)` / `FakeResponse(status_error=…)` serves all three cases (no per-scenario classes). Noted asymmetry: `post_error` takes a built exception; `status_error` takes a code the fake assembles into an `HTTPStatusError`.
- **`notes.md`: pytest cheatsheet extended** with a "Testing exceptions — `pytest.raises`" section.
- **Next**: the parked abstraction decision — `Protocol` vs ABC vs nothing for the backend `chat` seam. The Pylance warning (duck-typed `FakeClient` vs `client: httpx.Client | None`) is the concrete motivation — type the seam structurally.

---

### 2026-05-29 — `OllamaBackend` class, REPL extracted to `__main__.py`

- **`chat()` free function → `OllamaBackend` class.** Construction config + the `httpx` client live in `__init__`; the per-call `call_model(messages, *, system=None) -> ChatResult` reads everything off `self`. Split rule applied: stable / backend-specific / collaborators → constructor; per-call + must-be-uniform-across-backends → method.
- **DI seam moved to the constructor** (`client or httpx.Client()`) — tests now inject via `OllamaBackend(client=FakeClient())` rather than a method kwarg. The seam relocates with the collaborator.
- **REPL extracted to `agentAPI/__main__.py`** as `repl(backend)` — the consumer no longer lives inside a backend module (it was briefly a `chat()` *method* on the class; pulled out). `python -m agentAPI` runs it; `__init__.py` now publishes `OllamaBackend`.
- **Iterative review caught three bugs the green tests couldn't see**, all because the fake ignored the payload: (1) muddled split — method re-accepting `url`/`timeout`/`client` while `self.*` went dead (`timeout=None` silently disabled the timeout); (2) a dead `system` param (resolved, but the payload still sent `self.system_prompt`); (3) a malformed system message (`{"system": …}` vs `{"role": "system", "content": …}`).
- **Added an interaction (capture) test.** `FakeClient.post` now records `self.sent_payload`; a new test asserts the request's first message is a well-formed system message using the per-call override. Closes the request-side blind spot — output-only tests can't catch a malformed payload. 4 green.
- **Module hygiene:** the class briefly lived in `OllamaBackend.py` (CapWords) beside the old `ollama_backend.py`; collapsed into the single snake_case module, duplicate deleted. Docstring de-rotted (`token_ins`→`tokens_in`, "keys"→dataclass).
- **`notes.md`:** added two cheatsheets — "Python classes — function→object" (constructor-vs-method split, DI-via-constructor, conventions, consumer-vs-implementation) and "Abstraction — `Protocol` vs ABC" (nominal vs structural, enforcement timing, when to reach for each). Pylance's `FakeClient` warning relocated to the **constructor** — the Protocol pull now sits on two seams (the `client` param *and* the backend interface).
- **Next**: the `Protocol`-vs-ABC decision for the backend interface, then `AnthropicBackend` as the second implementation pressure-testing it.

### 2026-05-29 — `AnthropicBackend` class + test mirror, xfail as spec for the protocol gap

- **`AnthropicBackend` class landed** (user-written), shaped after `OllamaBackend`: config + lazy `anthropic.Anthropic()` client in `__init__`, `call_model(messages) -> ChatResult`. Translates `anthropic.APIConnectionError -> BackendConnectionError`.
- **User cleanups reviewed, all accepted:** deleted dead `old_anthropic.py`; removed a stray `print()` in `call_model`; moved `load_dotenv()` from import-time to inside `__init__` guarded by `client is None` (injected fakes skip the env read — reverses the prior import-side-effect placement, correctly); `str(e)` over `e.message`; `__main__.py` gained `choices=["ollama","anthropic"]` and dropped the dead `else` (bad `-b` now exits 2 via argparse instead of a lying exit 0); test deduped (unused imports + redundant `__init__` removed, renamed to `test_call_model_*`).
- **Anthropic test suite mirrored to Ollama's four shapes** (was happy-path only): added connection-error, status-error, payload-capture. `FakeMessage(create_error=...)` parameterized to serve happy + both error paths (mirrors Ollama's `FakeClient(post_error=...)`); `create` records `sent_kwargs` for the capture test.
- **Status-error test written as `xfail(strict=True)`.** `call_model` does not yet translate `anthropic.APIStatusError -> BackendResponseError` (that import is unused). Rather than skip the mirror or write the backend code (user's to write), the test encodes the target contract; strict xfail turns the suite **red on XPASS** the moment the behavior lands — a self-removing TODO. Division kept: Claude writes tests, user writes backend.
- **SDK facts confirmed empirically:** `APIConnectionError` has `.message`/`str(e)`; `APIStatusError` has `.status_code` + `.message`, and `RateLimitError`/`BadRequestError` subclass it (one `except` covers the family). Symmetric counterpart to Ollama's `RequestError`/`HTTPStatusError` split.
- **Protocol pull now on a second seam.** Duck-typed `FakeClient` vs `client: anthropic.Anthropic | None` raises the same nominal-typing Pylance warning as the Ollama fake — left visible as the marker. Combined with diverged `call_model` signatures (Ollama `(messages, *, system=None)` vs Anthropic `(messages)`), the parked interface decision now has concrete divergence to reconcile.
- **Suite: 7 passed, 1 xfailed.**
- **Next**: (1) implement Anthropic protocol-layer mapping (`except anthropic.APIStatusError -> BackendResponseError`), flipping the xfail and forcing marker removal; (2) reconcile the two `call_model` signatures, then the `Protocol`-vs-ABC-vs-nothing call for the backend seam (and the `client` seam).

### 2026-05-29 — Interface decision: wide contract + `Backend` Protocol, mypy verification

- **Decision made: wide contract + `typing.Protocol` (not ABC, not nothing).** Reasoning that settled it: (a) **two seams** exist — the *backend* seam (`repl → backend`, both sides ours) and the *client* seam (`backend → httpx/anthropic`, neither side ours, fakes duck-typed); only Protocol covers both, ABC can't touch the client seam. (b) Protocol checks the *signature*; ABC only checks method *presence*. (c) "Nothing" already worked at runtime — the point was to make drift checkable and silence the fake-injection warnings.
- **"Wide vs narrow" interrogated via a future-options question** (model, context length, temperature, ...). Conclusion: more options does **not** imply a wider method signature. Sort each option twice — *config vs per-call* and *common vs backend-specific*; only **common + per-call** belongs in the contract. `model`/`max_tokens`/context-length are construction config (already on `self`). The interface is the **intersection** of capabilities, not the union (a promised-but-ignored option is a Liskov leak). And the escape hatch for genuine growth is a **parameter object** (frozen dataclass), not an ever-growing keyword list: keyword-per-option = O(backends) churn (every impl must add it, or fail Protocol match); a params dataclass = O(1) interface churn (one field, backends opt-in). Trigger noted: introduce `GenerationParams` when a *second* common per-call knob appears. Today only `system` exists, so stay with the keyword.
- **Step 1 — widened `AnthropicBackend.call_model` to `(messages, *, system=None)`** with the same `if system is None: system = self.system_prompt` resolution as Ollama, feeding the *resolved* value (not `self.system_prompt`) into the call. The two backends are now signature-identical. Added `test_call_model_per_call_system_overrides_default` (default and override deliberately differ so the assert proves the override won) alongside the existing fallback-branch capture test — both branches covered.
- **Step 2 — `Backend(Protocol)` defined in `backend.py`** with one `call_model` stub (wide signature, body `...`). Syntax corrections along the way: body must be `...` not `return ChatResult()` (a Protocol describes, never runs — and `ChatResult()` is itself invalid, three required fields); params must be annotated (the annotations *are* the contract; unannotated = `Any` = nothing checked). **Turned it on** by annotating `repl(backend: Backend)` in `__main__.py` and exporting `Backend` via `__init__.__all__` — a Protocol nothing is annotated against is inert.
- **mypy installed and run — Protocol conformance verified.** `mypy agentAPI` is **silent** on `Backend` and on both `repl(...)` construction sites: both backends satisfy the Protocol under a real checker (stronger than the `inspect.signature` equality spot-check, which also showed exact match). Enforcement is otherwise editor-only (Pylance) until a `typecheck` target is added.
- **Cleanup: collapsed Anthropic's `kwargs` dict + `create(**kwargs)` splat into a direct keyword call.** The dict only existed for the old conditional `system=None` idiom, now obsolete (system is always resolved). This fixed the `dict[str, object]` overload error — building a dict joins heterogeneous value types to `object`, so the splat fed every arg in as `object` and matched no overload; a direct call preserves each arg's type.
- **Two real type issues un-masked by the direct call — PARKED.** (1) `messages: list[dict]` isn't assignable to the SDK's `Iterable[MessageParam]` (a bare dict isn't provably the `{role, content}` TypedDict) — cross-cutting, since `list[dict]` is the domain type across the Protocol + both backends; decision is `Message` TypedDict vs cast-at-boundary. (2) `response.content[0].text` is unsafe — `content` is a block union, only `TextBlock` has `.text`; this is the long-parked contract-layer assumption, now mypy-visible, and the real motivation to revive `BackendContractError` (narrow with `isinstance`, raise on the unexpected). `mypy agentAPI` stays red on these two by choice; runtime green.
- **Suite: 8 passed, 1 xfailed.** Interface-decision work is one coherent uncommitted unit.
- **Next**: still open — the `APIStatusError -> BackendResponseError` xfail; the two parked mypy findings (messages TypedDict + `content[0].text` narrowing); the client-seam Protocols (two narrow ones, since httpx vs anthropic clients have different shapes — would silence the `FakeClient` warnings).

---

### 2026-05-30 — Client-seam Protocols land, `FakeClient` warnings silenced

- **Client seam done (the parked item).** Two narrow `Protocol`s per backend, co-located in each module (underscore-prefixed = private seam; `backend.py` stays the shared consumer-facing contract). Ollama: `_Response` (`raise_for_status`/`json`) + `_HttpClient` (`post(url, *, json, timeout) -> _Response`). Anthropic: `_Messages` (`create(**kwargs) -> Any`) + `_AnthropicClient` (`messages: _Messages`, nested — the attribute *is* a protocol). Constructor params retyped from the concrete vendor classes to these protocols. The fakes now satisfy the seam structurally; no inheritance.
- **Two protocols per backend, not one** — the client's *return value* is duck-typed too (`FakeResponse`, `FakeMessage`'s namedtuples), so it needs its own protocol. Ollama is the clean case (both `httpx.Response` and the fake genuinely have `raise_for_status`/`json`).
- **Diagnosis that reframed the whole thing: the warnings were Pylance-only.** Bare `mypy agentAPI` never showed the `FakeClient` errors — mypy skips *unannotated* function bodies by default, and the test fns are unannotated. `mypy --check-untyped-defs agentAPI/tests` surfaces them (4 ollama + 4 anthropic, all `arg-type` on the `client=` constructor arg). So "silence Pylance" and "make mypy agree" were the same fix; the latter just needs the flag to *see* it.
- **`create(**kwargs) -> Any`, deliberately loose — the choice that preserves the two parked markers.** Because the param default still builds a real `anthropic.Anthropic()`, `self.client` infers to `_AnthropicClient | anthropic.Anthropic`; the *real* arm of that union keeps surfacing the messages-TypedDict + `content[0].text` errors left red on purpose. Typing `self.client` as the protocol alone (the alternative) would check the body against the narrow protocol and silently retire both TODOs — and need a `cast` for the real client (real `Messages.create` has a fixed signature, so it can't satisfy a `**kwargs` protocol method; the `list[dict]` vs `Iterable[MessageParam]` wall also reappears in the assignment). Chose to leave the parked work visible.
- **One *required* structural change beyond the annotations:** collapsed Anthropic's `if/else` to `if client is None: load_dotenv()` then `self.client = client or anthropic.Anthropic()`. The original `if`-branch assigned the real client first, so mypy pinned `self.client` to `Anthropic` and then rejected the `else` protocol assignment (a *new* error). Single assignment → union inferred directly. Bonus: now mirrors Ollama's `client or httpx.Client()` idiom.
- **Verified in a throwaway `/tmp` copy before handing over** (user applies edits; Claude doesn't). After edits on the real tree: `mypy --check-untyped-defs agentAPI` = exactly the 12 parked errors, 0 `FakeClient` errors, 0 new. **Suite: 8 passed, 1 xfailed.** Runtime untouched throughout — purely the static picture moved.
- **Next**: unchanged backlog — the `APIStatusError -> BackendResponseError` xfail; the two parked mypy findings (now the only red left); whether to add a `typecheck` Makefile target (and with `--check-untyped-defs`?) so the seam stays enforced outside the editor.

---

### 2026-05-30 — Follow-up: Pyright invariance on the nested client Protocol

- **The `FakeClient` warning persisted in the editor after the first fix** even though `mypy --check-untyped-defs` was clean. Wrong oracle: the warnings are **Pylance (Pyright)**, and the two checkers diverge here. Confirmed via `getDiagnostics` (live editor) and the local `pyright` CLI (1.1.409) — both showed 5 errors mypy didn't.
- **Root cause — mutable Protocol attribute is invariant.** `_AnthropicClient.messages: _Messages` (plain annotation) is *mutable* → Pyright requires the implementer's `messages` to be assignable **both** directions. `FakeClient.messages` is a `FakeMessage` (assignable *to* `_Messages`, not *from*), so the invariant check fails. mypy waved it through because the fake's `__init__(self, message)` param is unannotated → it inferred `messages: Any`.
- **Fix — make it read-only (covariant): one line.** `messages: _Messages` → `@property\n    def messages(self) -> _Messages: ...`. Read-only members are covariant, so one-directional assignability suffices. Ollama needed nothing — its `_HttpClient` seam is a `post` **method**, and methods don't carry the attribute-invariance constraint (that's why the Ollama test was clean all along).
- **Verified on all three:** pyright `0 errors` on both test files; `mypy --check-untyped-defs agentAPI` still exactly the 12 parked markers; pytest 8 passed / 1 xfailed. `anthropic_backend.py` also carries a Pylance *hint* (`BackendResponseError` unused import) — expected, it's the placeholder for the parked `APIStatusError -> BackendResponseError` mapping.
- **Lesson banked:** for anything Pylance-facing, verify with `pyright`, not mypy — mypy's leniency on unannotated-fake attributes and on mutable-attribute variance makes it a false green for editor warnings.

---

### 2026-05-30 — `Message` TypedDict + boundary cast (parked marker #1 retired)

- **Input seam now rigorously typed.** Introduced a vendor-neutral `Message` TypedDict in `backend.py` (next to `ChatResult`): `role: Literal["user","assistant"]`, `content: str`. Threaded `list[dict]` → `list[Message]` through the `Backend` Protocol and both backends' `call_model`, exported via `__init__.__all__`. System prompt is *not* a `Message` in either backend (Anthropic `system=` kwarg; Ollama prepends its own payload dict), so user/assistant is the whole interface vocabulary.
- **Empirical result — confirms the notes.md gotcha live: `list[Message]` still isn't assignable to `Iterable[MessageParam]`,** and this time **mypy *and* pyright agree**. Reason: **TypedDict fields are mutable → invariant in subtyping.** `Message.content: str` vs the SDK's `content: str | Iterable[ContentBlockParam]` — `str` is a *subtype* of that union, but invariance demands *equality*, so `Message` is not a subtype of `MessageParam`. **Typing alone can't close this** — it's structural law, not a missing annotation.
- **Resolved with a single boundary `cast`.** `messages=cast(list[MessageParam], messages)` at the one `create(...)` call (`from anthropic.types import MessageParam` — vendor import is fine *inside* the Anthropic backend). An **honest** cast: a `Message` genuinely *is* a valid `MessageParam` at runtime, so we're asserting a truth the type system can't express, not hiding a bug. Confined to the one value the checker can't verify; everything upstream stays checked.
- **`list` invariance demonstrated twice in one change.** The test global needed `MOCK_MESSAGE: list[Message]` (an inferred `list[dict[str,str]]` is *not* assignable to `list[Message]`) — same invariance that forces the SDK cast. Good repeat of the theme running through this whole stretch.
- **The stricter type earned its keep — flushed out a real `list[dict]` gap in the REPL.** `__main__.py` built `messages: list[dict]` and `user_msg` (a `dict[str,str]`), both rejected once `call_model` wanted `list[Message]`. Fixed: `messages: list[Message]`, `user_msg: Message = {...}` (annotation gives the literal a context type so `"user"` narrows to the Literal). Inconsistency the loose type had been hiding.
- **State: `12 → 11`.** The only red left in the package is marker #2 — the response-side `content[0].text` union (the `isinstance`/`BackendContractError` job). `mypy --check-untyped-defs` = 11 (all #2); Pylance on `backend.py`/`__main__.py` clean. **Suite: 8 passed, 1 xfailed.**
- **Tooling note banked:** the editor runs Pylance in **basic** mode (`.vscode/settings.json`); the `pyright` CLI defaults to **standard** (stricter), so the CLI can over-report vs. what's actually in the editor — `getDiagnostics` is the editor source of truth.
- **Surfaced but out of scope (pre-existing):** the Ollama payload-capture test asserts on `client.sent_payload`, which Pylance infers as `None` (the fake's `post(json=None)` is unannotated) → "None is not subscriptable". Independent of this work; parked.
- **Next**: marker #2 (response-side narrowing / `BackendContractError`); the `sent_payload` fake-typing nit; the `APIStatusError -> BackendResponseError` xfail; maybe a `typecheck` Make target.

---

### 2026-05-30 — Marker #2 retired: response-side narrowing + `BackendContractError` revived

- **The last package red is gone.** `AnthropicBackend.call_model` no longer does the unsafe `response.content[0].text`. It binds `block = response.content[0]`, guards with `isinstance(block, TextBlock)`, and reads `.text` only in the narrowed branch. `mypy --check-untyped-defs agentAPI` = **clean** (was 11), pyright on the backend = **0 errors**.
- **`BackendContractError` brought back from the 2026-05-27 deletion — and this time it carries information.** It was removed then because the wrapper added nothing over a bare `KeyError`. Now the message names the offending type (`type(block)`), which a bare `IndexError`/`AttributeError` never could. Added to `backend.py` alongside the existing two; exported is N/A (stays internal to the hierarchy, surfaced via `BackendError`).
- **Mental-model correction banked (took a few passes): a contract error is *raised*, not *caught*.** The connection/protocol layers translate exceptions the SDK throws *at* you (`except ... raise`). A contract violation is different in kind — the call **succeeds** (200, real `Message`), the *value shape* is wrong. There's no exception in flight to catch; you inspect the value and raise yourself. Early attempts reached for an `except BackendContractError` clause (dead code — nothing in the `try` raises it) and `if response is None` guards (impossible per the SDK types: `create()` returns `Message`, `.content` is `list[ContentBlock]`, neither is `None`). The real failure modes were empty list and wrong-block-type — only `isinstance` addresses the latter.
- **`isinstance` narrowing is one line doing two jobs** — runtime guard (genuinely distinguishes `TextBlock` from `ToolUseBlock`/etc.) *and* union narrowing (what makes `.text` provably present, flipping mypy green). No `cast` could do this honestly: unlike marker #1 (where a `Message` truly *is* a `MessageParam` at runtime), here `content[0]` genuinely might not be text — the checker was flagging a real latent bug, not a missing annotation.
- **mypy false-green caught by pyright — again.** First working version wrote `response.content[0]` twice (guard + return). mypy carried the narrowing across the two statements; **pyright did not** (won't assume a repeated `a.b[0]` refers to the same object) → 11 `reportAttributeAccessIssue` on the non-text union members. Fix: bind the local `block` once. Robust in both checkers, stops evaluating the subscript three times. Reinforces the banked lesson — verify Pylance-facing fixes with pyright.
- **Predicted test fallout landed: `isinstance` is nominal, can't be duck-typed.** The Anthropic fakes returned a home-rolled `Content = namedtuple("Content", ["text"])`; the new guard rejected it (3 reds) because a structural look-alike is not a `TextBlock`. Fix (Claude's lane — tests): construct a **real** `TextBlock(text="hi", type="text")` (`citations` defaults to `None`). Nice contrast with the *client* seam, which stays `Protocol`/duck-typed — only the single value flowing through a nominal `isinstance` must be the real type; `Usage`/`Response` namedtuples are untouched.
- **State: 11 → 0 package reds.** **Suite: 8 passed, 1 xfailed.** mypy clean, pyright clean on backend + the touched test file.
- **Empty-`content` guard consciously deferred.** `content[0]` on `[]` still raises `IndexError` before the `isinstance`. Noted, not built — fail-loud in dev is acceptable; add a dedicated guard if it ever bites.
- **Next**: the `APIStatusError -> BackendResponseError` xfail (still the one `BackendResponseError` import sitting unused in `anthropic_backend.py` as its placeholder); the `sent_payload` Ollama fake-typing nit; maybe a `typecheck` Make target so the seam stays enforced outside the editor.

---

### 2026-05-30 — Logging thread: `getLogger`, the library/application split, the httpcore flood

- **Direction set by stepping back.** Mapped the remaining work into three buckets: tool calling (marquee; also the only thread that activates the dormant *bash-fluency* craft via subprocess), conversation-as-abstraction (already half-works in `repl()`), and cross-cutting craft gaps (logging, iteration). Surfaced that of the three project crafts, **bash fluency is still at zero**. Chose **logging first** (user pick) — self-contained, and doing it before the tool loop means the loop is observable from birth rather than retrofitted.
- **`getLogger(__name__)` in `ollama_backend.py`; configure at the edge in `__main__.py`.** The split is the whole lesson: a library only *gets a logger and emits*; the application *configures once*. Framed as **the `load_dotenv()`-at-the-edge principle again** — configuring logging is a process-wide global side effect, not a library's call to make.
- **The httpcore flood — the centerpiece.** `basicConfig(level=DEBUG)` configures the **root** logger (handler + floor); every logger **propagates** up to root's handler; the level check happens **once** at the originating logger. So one global setting turned DEBUG on for the *entire dependency tree* — `httpcore`/`httpx` had been emitting into the void all along and suddenly had a destination. Fix: floor root at `WARNING` (`basicConfig(level="WARNING")`) and raise only our namespace (`getLogger("agentAPI").setLevel(DEBUG)`). httpcore inherits the floor → silenced; `agentAPI.*` has an explicit DEBUG ancestor → survives.
- **Two-bug slip caught at review, both instructive.** User wrote `logger = logging.getLogger("agentAPI").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)`. (1) `setLevel()` is an in-place **mutator → returns `None`**, so `logger` was `None` (Pylance flagged `.debug`; would `AttributeError` at runtime). (2) It **fused two responsibilities at two layers** — *getting* the logger (library) with *setting the level* (application config), and hardcoded `"agentAPI"` instead of `__name__`. Fixed by splitting: `getLogger(__name__)` in the module, `getLogger("agentAPI").setLevel(DEBUG)` migrated into `__main__.py`.
- **Empirically verified** via a piped non-interactive REPL run (`printf 'say hi\n/quit\n' | python -m agentAPI -b ollama`): `DEBUG:agentAPI.ollama_backend:...` lines appear with the correct nested name, **zero httpcore/httpx noise**, assistant reply still prints. The library/application model works end to end.
- **`datefmt` Q&A banked:** formats the `%(asctime)s` field with `time.strftime` codes; inert unless `%(asctime)s` is in `format`; a custom `datefmt` **drops the default comma-millis** (use `%(msecs)03d` in `format` to recover). Picked `"%H:%M:%S"` for the live REPL (date is noise within a session).
- **Decision: token display stays duplicated, deliberately.** The backend now `logger.debug`s `Tokens in/out` *and* `repl()` still `print`s them. Not a bug — they serve different audiences: the print is **UX** (user may want to see it), the debug line is **diagnostics**. Different homes for different purposes.
- **`notes.md`: full `logging` cheatsheet added** — why-not-`print`, the five pieces, `getLogger(__name__)`, levels + effective-level rule, the library/application split, `basicConfig` (configures *root*, no-ops if handled), propagation + the global-level trap with the floor-and-raise fix, `format`/`datefmt` tables, lazy `%`-formatting (+ `logger.exception`), and gotchas (mutators return `None`, duplicate lines via double-handling, `datefmt` needs `asctime`).
- **Anthropic backend mirrored** — same two moves (`getLogger(__name__)` + `logger.debug` in `call_model`), so both backends now emit. Caught a copy-paste bug on the way in: the Anthropic response-debug line read "from ollama" — the error-message-specificity principle (2026-05-27) again, fixed to "anthropic".
- **Side cleanup (user):** typed `FakeClient.post` in the Ollama test (`url: str, *, json: dict[str, Any], timeout: float) -> FakeResponse`), which **clears the parked `sent_payload` Pylance nit** — the capture field is now a `dict`, not `None`, so the subscript type-checks. Committed separately from the logging work.
- **Next**: the deferred **tool-calling** thread (activates bash). Still-open backlog: the `APIStatusError -> BackendResponseError` xfail, a possible `typecheck` Make target.
